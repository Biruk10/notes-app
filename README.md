Functionality: This is a web application, the Online Notes App Management System, that is designed to securely create, manage, and organize your personal notes. The application provides complete user authentication whereby a user can register themselves with their name, email, and password and then log in to their own dashboard. Being authenticated, the user will be allowed to perform full CRUD operations on their notes: create new notes with title and description, see all their notes organized in a dashboard, edit already created notes, and delete notes they don't need anymore. Each user's notes will be private and isolated, and thus no user will have any access to the management of other users' content. Success and error messages make the application interactive in real time.

Technology Stack: This is a full-stack application developed with modern web development technologies, keeping the best practices in mind. The client-side user interface is built using React.js version 18, React Router for routing, Axios for API calls, and Bootstrap 5 through the CDN link for responsive UI, which includes a custom yellow theme and Times New Roman typography. The server-side logic is powered by Node.js with the Express.js framework, defining RESTful API routes for authentication and notes management. Security is introduced through bcrypt to hash user passwords and JSON Web Tokens to provide stateless authentication and protected routes. This is a PostgreSQL relational database with appropriately structured tables. It provides for foreign key relationships between users and notes, enhancing data integrity and ensuring efficient data querying. Architecture: The code maintains a logical structure, separating concerns into distinct modules, namely routes, authentication middleware, and configuration based on environment settings.
